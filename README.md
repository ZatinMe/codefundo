# flood prediction using satellite data and machine learning

Floods are one of the most frequent and severe natural disasters. In addition to causing a huge economic damage (to the human property) they cause a substantial loss of human lives.

Water flow in streams depends on rain, snow melting, run-off, control by nearby by Dam/Reservoir and various other factors. Using Machine Learning one can find patterns of water flow in river. These models need a lot of input data. For simplicity, we are using only stream discharge and precipitation for prediction.

Checking various machine learning algorithms like neural net, K-NN, linear regression, etc and choosing the best suited one for the assigned task. And implementing it in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

As I couldn't get discharge data for Indian rivers (https://www.researchgate.net/post/Where_can_I_get_discharge_data_for_few_rivers_of_India_Gandak_River_Ghaghara_Kosi_Gomti). Instead I have used data from USA weather forecast:

discharge data source: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt

precipitation data source: https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/
